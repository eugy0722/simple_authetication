# Authentication and Login Project

This repo contains the source code and a doc for an Login Project for user login on a system. 

The main purpose is to develop a secure authentication system regarding Simplified Process, Password Security, User Authentication, Authorization, Security Best Practices, Libriries and Frameworks.    

## Features

1.  *   User Login Page

2.  *   Welcoming Page

## Technologies

*   JavaScript: high level programming language allow us developing websites and web app.
*   Node.js: is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment.
*   HTML: markup linguage for writing web pages.
*   Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): A widely used style sheet language that controls the presentation of documents written in HTML.

## Installation/Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://https://github.com/dolthub/dolt`
2.  **Open the project:** simple_authentication.
3.  **Open terminal(Linux or MacOs)/cmd(Windows):** 
4.  **Install dependences:** run the command **npm install**
5.  **Start the Server:** run the command **npm run start**

## Improvements/Future Development

**1. Password Security:**
* **Database:**
    * Integrate a database MongoDB to store user credentials.
* **Hashing:**
    * Never store passwords in plain text. Always hash them using strong, one-way hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    * Understand the importance of salting passwords to prevent rainbow table attacks.
* **Password Policies:**
    * Implement password complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, symbols).
    * Consider password expiration and rotation policies.
* **Secure Storage:**
    * Ensure that hashed passwords are stored securely in a database or other secure storage.

**2. User Authentication:**
* **Authentication Methods:**
    * Understand different authentication methods username/password.
    * Learn how to implement these methods securely.
* **Session Management:**
    * Learn how to manage user sessions securely.
    * Understand the use of session IDs, cookies, and tokens.
    * Implement secure session expiration and invalidation.
* **Token-Based Authentication (JWT):**
    * Learn how JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) work.
    * Understand how to generate, verify, and store JWTs securely.
    * Learn about JWT best practices, such as short expiration times and proper signing.

**3. Authorization:**
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    * Understand how to implement RBAC to control user access to resources.
    * Learn how to define roles and permissions.
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
    * Understand the concept of ACLs.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * Always grant users only the permissions they need to perform their tasks.

**4. Security Best Practices:**
* **Input Validation:**
    * Validate all user input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS)).
* **HTTPS:**
    * Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:**
    * Implement CSRF protection to prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests on behalf of authenticated users.
* **Security Headers:**
    * Learn how to use security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security) to enhance security.
* **Regular Security Audits:**
    * Perform regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **Error Handling:**
    * Avoid giving too much information in error messages. For example, when a log in fails, do not tell the user if the user name, or password was incorrect. Just that the log in failed.
* **Rate Limiting:**
    * Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

**5. Libraries and Frameworks:**
* **Authentication Libraries:**
    * Become familiar with popular authentication libraries and frameworks (e.g., Passport.js, Auth0, Firebase Authentication).
* **Security Libraries:**
    * Learn how to use libraries that help secure your application.
